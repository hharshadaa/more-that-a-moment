    <p>Discrimination is the unfair or prejudicial treatment of people and groups based on characteristics such as race, gender, age or sexual orientation, which often stems from our own fears and misunderstandings. Although there are laws in place to target major forms of discrimination such as The Fair Housing Act or The Civil Rights Act, discrimination still occurs across America, mostly in the form of smaller day-to-day discriminatory actions known as micro aggressions.  These include snubs, slights, misguided comments that a person doesnâ€™t belong, and invalidation of personal experiences. 
 </p>
<p>
At More Than A Moment, we believe that our differences make us stronger together.  Our goal is to educate others about the long-term effects of discrimination on minority groups in order to foster a more inclusive community. </p>
