  <h4>  <a href = "https://www.pgaction.org/gei/sogi/">Parliamentarians for Global Action (PGA) - Campaign</a> </h4>
      <p> Stigma, violence and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people contribute significantly to their exclusion from society, limit their access to health and other critical services and hinder social and economic development. PGA’s vision is to contribute to the creation of a Rules-Based International Order for a more equitable, safe, sustainable and democratic world.</p>

   <h4> <a href = "https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/discrimination/">Amnesty International - Campaign</a> </h4>
      <p>  Amnesty International’s work is rooted in the principle of non-discrimination. We all have the right to be treated equally, regardless of our race, ethnicity, nationality, class, caste, religion, belief, sex, gender, language, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex characteristics, age, health or other status. Working with communities across the world, we challenge discriminatory laws and practices to ensure all people can enjoy their rights on an equal basis.</p>

None of us can afford to sit back and wait for equality to arrive – we need to act now. Only by working together will we achieve the legal and systemic change needed to address violence and discrimination against women and girls.

 <h4>   <a href = " https://www.change.org/p/support-the-equality-act?source_location=petitions_browse">Support the Equality Act - Petition</a> </h4>
<p> Last year, the House has passed the Equality Act, which would protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in their places of work, homes, schools, and other public accommodations. The next step is that the bill will go before the Senate. Let’s show our pride by demanding that, on a national level, our laws truly treat all of our citizens equally.</p>

  <h4>  <a href = "https://www.change.org/p/uk-government-ban-hair-discrimination-in-the-uk">Ban Hair Discrimination In The UK - Petition</a></h4>
<p> It isn’t difficult to find a black person who can speak about how their hair has affected their lives in both subtle and life-changing ways. It’s not ok for people to be targeted because of their hair. That’s why, I’m calling on the UK Government to ban hair discrimination by amending the equalities act. Please help by signing this petition. </p>

<p> Today, I’m asking for your help to ensure that this type of discrimination ends with my family – I am asking for financial support to make a change for the greater good of all those living with autism and their families. Any excess funds raised will be donated to various autism-related organizations providing supports and advocating for social change for those living with autism and their families. </p>

<p> On April 7, 2022, The Human Rights Campaign collaborated with Warner Media to launch a video campaign called “Let Us Play” that features transgender youth playing sports with their friends. It calls for legislators across the country to allow these children to play their sport. We ask for our North Carolina legislators to support the Human Rights Campaign by proposing a bill that will protect transgender athletes against discrimination in school sports. Any donations received will go to this campaign. Thank you so much for your donation and please contact us for any further information. </p>
